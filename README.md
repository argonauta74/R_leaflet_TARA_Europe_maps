## This repository contains the R script associated with the manuscript:
  
XXX et al. (2024)

## Description
This script generates an interactive leaflet map to facilitate the visualization of sampling stations for specific coastal ocean areas. 
Colored markers denote each station and include pop-up windows displaying basic station-specific (e.g., lat, lon, date) information. 
The leaflet integrates multiple layers (i.e., environmental parameters), such as bathymetry and chlorophyll satellite data; however, other layers can be added according to the user's needs. 
The map features include a scale bar, mini-map, measuring tools, a reset map button, and GPS control. The R script is commented, and the R packages needed are as follows:

1. Leaflet v. 2.2.0.9
2. Leaflet.Extras v.1.0.0
3. Leafem v. 0.2.3

## Installation

To run these scripts, you need to install R and the required R packages. You can install R from [The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/).
