XXX et al. (2024)

## Description

This script generates an interactive leaflet map to facilitate the visualization of sampling stations.
Each station is denoted by colored markers and includes pop-up windows displaying basic station-specific (e.g., lat, lon, date) information. 
The leaflet integrates multiple layers which can be toggled according to the user's needs, including bathymetry and chlorophyll satellite data. 
Additional environmental parameters can be added as layers if necessary. Features of the map include a scale bar, mini map, measuring tools, a reset map button, and GPS control.

## Installation

To run these scripts, you need to install R and the required R packages. You can install R from [The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/).
