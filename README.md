## This repository contains the R script associated with the manuscript:
  
Marchese et al. under review in DIY Oceanography (https://tos.org/diy-oceanography) 

## Description
This script generates an interactive leaflet map to facilitate the visualization of sampling stations for specific coastal ocean areas. 
Colored markers denote each station and include pop-up windows displaying basic station-specific information (e.g., station number, lat, lon, sampling dates, etc.). 
The leaflet integrates multiple layers (i.e., environmental parameters), such as bathymetry and surface chlorophyll-a from satellite data; however, other layers (i.e., geospatial data) can be added according to the user's needs. 
The map features include a scale bar, mini-map, measuring tools, a reset map button, GPS control, and more. The R script is commented, and the main R packages needed are as follows:

1. Leaflet v. 2.2.0.9
2. Leaflet.Extras v.1.0.0
3. Leafem v. 0.2.3
