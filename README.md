## This repository contains the R script associated with the manuscript:
  
XXX et al. (2024)

## Description

This script generates an interactive leaflet map to facilitate the visualization of sampling stations for specific coastal ocean areas.
Each station is denoted by colored markers and includes pop-up windows displaying basic station-specific (e.g., lat, lon, date) information. 
The leaflet integrates multiple layers (i.e., environmental parameters) such as bathymetry and chlorophyll satellite data - however, according to the user's needs, other layer can be added. 
Features of the map include a scale bar, mini map, measuring tools, a reset map button, and GPS control.

## Installation

To run these scripts, you need to install R and the required R packages. You can install R from [The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/).
